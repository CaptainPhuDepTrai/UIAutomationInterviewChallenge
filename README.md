# UI Automation Technical Challenge

Welcome! You are here because we would like to see how you think about, design and write test code. Please follow the instructions and leave any comments or edits in your fork of the readme.

## Instructions
- fork this repo (ensure it remains private)
- remove all colaborators from the repository
- perform the technical challenge in a branch off main
- create a PR into main when you are done
- add @rysbilinski back to the repository for review

## The Challenge

Using playwright (https://playwright.dev/dotnet/), create a UI testing project which tests the following features of Figma (https://www.figma.com/):

- create account
- login
- create a new design file
- rename the design file
- search for a template in the community

Remember, your tests need to be repeatable ;)

Good luck!
