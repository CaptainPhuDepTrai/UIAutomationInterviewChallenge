# The Challenge

Using playwright (https://playwright.dev/dotnet/), create a UI testing project which tests the following features of Figma (https://www.figma.com/):

- create account
- login
- create a new design file
- rename the design file
- search for a template in the community

Remember, your tests need to be repeatable ;)

Good luck!
